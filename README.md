## :telescope: Tips for a successful demo-app

Implementing all full-blown project with various libraries might seem a bit overwhelming, we understand that.

However, this is the most interesting part for us ! It will give us a lot of material to get to know how you would work with us here at Job4. Here is a list of tips you should keep in the back of your head while working on the demo-app :

- You are not coding for yourself : prioritize clarity and readability over efficiency.
- Stay within the given timeline
- Have fun doing your test (ex: feel free to take this opportunity to learn about new tech !)
